Some comments on how the address files for the jen corpus were generated.

beet.rondo - best performance from meter program is with chord_weight
= 1.0, max_effective_length = 0.5, duple_bonus = 1.0 (prechords were
added by hand). Regarding addresses, the triplets near the end are
tricky: the first one is represented properly, but the second one
can't be because it's a simultaneous 3:2.

beet.son10-1.II - boost duple_bonus to 1.0

beet.son10-3.II - weak 64th notes are below the lowest metrical level,
and are represented as extrametrical.

beet.son13.II - One erroneous note commented out in m. 1 of notefile.
Program gets tactus level correct (eighth) naturally, unlike on
quantized file.

beet.son14-1.III - One erroneous note commented out in m. 4 of
notefile. Reduce tactus range to (350, 700) to force right choice of
tactus level.

beet.son2-3.III - one hypermetrical level removed from nbfile.

beet.son27-2.I - one note left out in notefile, F# in m. 8. Raised tactus_min
to 600 to force correct level. Sixteenth notes in melody are represented on
level 0 beats.

chop.maz63-2 - several notes seem to be wrong or missing in notefile;
see m. 15 for example. One HM level removed from nbfile.

chop.maz67-2 - the performer really seems to play the grace-note ->
eighth figures more like two sixteenths, starting on the beat. They are
encoded as notated, though.

chop.noc27-1 - note commented out of notefile in m. 51. Several notes
missing, e.g. in m. 50. In nafile, sixteenth-notes are assigned to
lowest-level beats.
	In fifth measure of excerpt, the C# in the bass is present in
notefile but only has a duration of 29 ms. This means it is dropped by
the meter program and does not register in the nbfile (though it does
show up on the meter program's graphic display). This note was
restored to the correct ANote file.

haydn.son30.I - trills are problematic; I just let the notes fall where
they may in terms of beats.

mzt.pc488.II - note commented out of m. 11 of notefile.

mzt.son330.II - note missing in m. 21. Set tactus range at (800,
1200), width at 1.5, to force correct tactus.

schub.bfson.I - note commented out of m. 154 in notefile, also one in m. 
166.
